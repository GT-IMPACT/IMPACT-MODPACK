What is a TileEntity? It's a block that has some logic.

impact.167.name=Small Coal Boiler

impact.167.desc=At this stage, you will need to produce steam.%n%nSteam is produced by boilers. The first available boiler is the Small Coal Boiler.%n%nHow it works:%nWater and fuel are supplied, and steam is produced.%nProduces 120 L/s of steam.%n%nThe boiler has a minimum temperature of 20 and a maximum of 500. Every 45 ticks, the boiler's temperature decreases by 1. Every 12 ticks, 1 energy is consumed from the current fuel, increasing the temperature by 1. However, when the boiler reaches its maximum temperature, it will stop consuming fuel for further heating. This means that during heating, coal will burn for only 96 seconds, but when the boiler is fully heated, the coal will burn for 360 seconds, equivalent to 43,200 liters of steam.%n%nThe boiler can hold up to 16,000 liters of steam or 16,000 liters of water. As long as the boiler's temperature is above 100, every 25 ticks, the boiler will consume 1 liter of water and produce 150 liters of steam. Temperatures above 100 do not increase the steam production rate. The boiler will attempt to release steam through all sides of the block except the bottom. Through the bottom side, the boiler accepts water, allowing water pipes to be placed below the line of boilers. If the steam storage is full, a quarter of its capacity will be released, and as a warning, smoke particles and a hissing sound will be created.%n%nWater can be added to the boiler by right-clicking it with a water bucket or by placing any water capsule in a special slot in the boiler. Like any GregTech machine, it will return an empty capsule. If the water runs out in a boiler heated above 100, an explosion will occur when water is added. Therefore, it is necessary to wait for it to cool down.%n%nFuel (Energy):%n- Coal - 160 units%n- Charcoal - 160 units%n- Lignite - 120 units%n- Coal Coke - 320 units

impact.178.name=Simple Solar Boiler

impact.178.desc=This is a primitive boiler that produces steam using solar heat. When heated, the solar boiler has the same steam output as a small coal boiler, producing 150L of steam every 25 ticks.%n%nOperating Principle:%nThe Solar Boiler uses the same heating and cooling math as the small coal boiler, but its "fuel" is more complex.%n%nEvery 256 ticks, the boiler checks if it can see the sun. If it can, it gives itself 8 fuel units. During (approximately) 5 seconds (8x12 = 96 ticks), it is active and its heat increases by 6 (+8-2). Over the next 8 seconds, it loses 3.25 heat (-1 for 45 ticks), resulting in a net change of ~2.75 heat over 13 seconds of daylight or approximately 0.21 degrees per second. Therefore, it takes the cold solar boiler 6.3 minutes to start producing steam (temperature from 20 to 100>). Since a Minecraft day only lasts 10 minutes, if you don't sleep, the Solar Boiler will only generate Steam for about 5.5 minutes out of every 20-minute full day (3.7 minutes during the day, 1.8 minutes to cool down after darkness sets in). Thus, to make solar boilers practical, constant bed operation is required.%n%nThe Solar Boiler requires 38 minutes of continuous sunlight to reach maximum temperature (500). Unlike other boilers, the maximum temperature has no effect on the solar boiler.%n%nThe boiler can hold 16,000L of steam and 16,000L of water. As long as its temperature is above 100, every 25 ticks it will consume 1L of water and produce 150L of steam. Temperatures above 100 do not affect steam production. The boiler will attempt to output steam from all sides except the bottom. However, it will accept water input from below through a pipe, allowing water piping to safely run underneath the line of boilers. If the steam tank becomes full, 1/4 of its capacity will be discarded, and a smoke particle and sound effect will be emitted as a warning.%n%nWater can be added to the boiler by right-clicking on the machine with water buckets or by placing any type of water cell in the water input slot in the graphical interface. Like all GregTech machines, it returns an empty cell. If the temperature is above 100 and the boiler runs out of water, adding water will cause an explosion, so wait until it cools down.%n%nCalcification:%nAs the boiler remains active, it will slowly calcify, decreasing steam output. Calcification begins after 10,000 steam production cycles (250,000 ticks, 208 minutes 20 seconds, just under 3.5 hours), after which steam output decreases by 1L every 100 production cycles, down to a minimum of 50L every 25 ticks (1/3 normal output) after another 208 minutes and 20 seconds. This timer and its effects are reset if the boiler is picked up and moved (it does not store in the item). The goal of this change was to force manual interaction with low-tech single-block boilers rather than simply ensuring their continuous operation through automation.%n%nNote that the time the boiler spends below 100 temperature (not producing steam) is not counted towards calcification. In practice, this means that since (as noted above) the Solar Boiler operates for 5.5 minutes out of every 20-minute days, on a non-sleeping server, the Solar Boiler will operate for approximately 12 hours before it starts losing output to calcification.

impact.179.name=Charcoal Pile Igniter

impact.179.desc=Obtaining charcoal.%n%nCharcoal Pile Igniter is a method of producing charcoal faster than in a coke oven, but without the simplicity of automation and creosote.%n%nWorking principle:%nThe multi-block charcoal pile consists of a bottom layer of bricks, ranging in size from 3x3 to 11x11. Place up to 5 layers of logs on top of the bricks that you want to turn into charcoal, then place the igniter on top in the center. Cover all surfaces of the logs with dirt, and then activate the igniter with a flint and steel. If the top part of the igniter starts to glow, the process has started.%n%nOnce the process is complete, you can remove the blocks of dirt. Instead of logs, you will have charred blocks from which charcoal drops.
