## What is this modpack?

Global industrial modpack for Minecraft 1.7.10, based on GregTech 5 and various mods deeply integrated with each other. There has never been such integration in Minecraft with mods.

The main advantage of this build is the modification of each mod for the realities of GregTech. It is here that this mod is integrated into every era, from basic machines to interdimensional travel.
